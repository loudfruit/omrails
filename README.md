The navbar contains buttons for signup and signout. 
I want these buttons to appear on the top right hand side of the navbar.

Currently I have implemented a pull-md-right class on the list items for the two buttons being used but the desired behaviour is not happening.

Here are suggestions for debugging from Svetlana from One Month:

ok, so you need to go to github and creat a new branch

[8:56]  
then you can run git branch in the command line

[8:56]  
to see all the branches you have

[8:56]  
you should have master and the new one that you just created

[8:57]  
then you can use git checkout <new_branch> to switch

[8:58]  
that's how you can make all the mess and still be able to go back to your previous code

[9:02]  
you can aslo use git checkout <commit_number> to go back to any previous commits, to find the commit_number you need to run git log first, then pick the commit you want to start with and replace <commit_number> with actual commit number, just don't forget to roll back your migrations before, but if you wish you can always drop the database

[9:02]  
let me know if i can help with anything else
